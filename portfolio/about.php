<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		I'm a Michigan native and 3 year resident of Seattle with a healthy sense of adventure.  I moved because I love both mountains and large bodies of water, and didn't want to choose between the two!  Prior to becoming a tech aficionado, I spent 8 years working either part or full time as a non-profit professional.  I'm passionate about social justice issues and community organizing, but eventually realized that I couldn't see myself turning it into a long-term career.

		Luckily, I already knew some basic HTML and CSS from back in high school when 
		I used to make websites for my friends as a hobby, so I picked it back up in early 
		2012 with the intention of discerning web design as a possible career.  In fall 
		of 2013 I enrolled in both the Web Design and Web Technology Solutions certificates 
		through the University of Washington, and the rest is history.  I'm very much looking forward
		to joining the tech workforce full time.

<h3>These are a few of my favorite things:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>yoga - I'm a 200hr certified yoga instructor, and I'm involved in a work exchange at my yoga studio in order to receive free classes.</li>
		<li>biking - My husband and I consider ourselves to be the most hardcore leisure bikers in Seattle.  SOMEONE has to be at the back of the pack, so it might as well be us.</li>
		<li>food - both eating out and cooking in.  My favorite restaurants in Seattle are Red Mill, Delancy's, 8oz Burger Bar, Cafe Bengodi, Salumi, and any place that serves queso.  My favorite things to cook at home are risotto, paella, pad thai, and any sort of Mexican food. </li>
	 	<li>traveling - In 2013 I visited Costa Rica, and next on the list is Thailand to visit my parents, who are expats.</li>
	 	<li>cats - because cats are the best, that's why.</li>	
	</ol>
