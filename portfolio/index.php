<h2>Hello, I'm Britt.</h2>
	<p>
	<br />
		I'm a front-end developer and nature lover.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Web design and development engages my mind in a similar way to music, 
		and I treat each language as a new instrument to learn. 
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		I'm creative and enterprising, always looking for ways to evolve and to live more fully.  
		As an employee you'll find I can happily learn to do just about anything, 
		much faster than you'd expect.  Hire me, and you'll learn the definition of “hard working”.  
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		My prior work in social services has taught me to ask the tough questions 
		and to build a vision in all the work that I do.  My websites aren't just code, 
		they are on a mission.  Care to join? 
	</p>
