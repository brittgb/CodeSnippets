			<h1>ITA 341 - Assignment 1</h1>
			<h2>Item 1: Look up JavaScript reserved Words</h2>
			<p>
				I visisted http://www.javascripter.net/faq/reserved.htm.  Mostly, the words weren't ones I'd likely use anyways, but the second list of "things you'd better avoid" was a different story.  This list contains words that aren't considered reserved words but shouldn't be used because they are predefined names of implementation-dependent JavaScript objects, methods, or properties.  I can definitely see a number of those being a problem for some people, such as: clientInformation, hidden, history, radio, status, alert, Date, document, and location.  Seeing this will make me think twice in the future when I'm naming variables.

			<h2>Item 2: Find out what hoisting is</h2>
			<p>
				I visited http://www.sitepoint.com/back-to-basics-javascript-hoisting/.  I learned that hoisting is one of the things that sometimes causes quirks in JavaScript, especially when you are taking advantage of JavaScript's flexibility.  JavaScript can deal with variables declared in almost any location, and it uses hoist to move all variables and function declarations to the top of the current scope.  However, functions that are assigned to variables are not hoisted.  Furthermore, only declarations are hosted but assignments are left in place.  Therefore, depending on what information you might omit and the order you put things in, you could create errors.
