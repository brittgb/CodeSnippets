QUESTION: Which browser do you currently use? Which browser do you intend to use for this course? What is the exact version number, and what platform (OS) are you running on? Describe any reasons for this preference and if any of the readings this week will influence your decisions in the future?:
</p>
<p>
I currently use both Chrome and Firefox, but predominantly stick with Chrome.  For this class, I'll be using Google Chrome version 32.0.1700.77. I keep Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on hand to test site aesthetics but I prefer to use Chrome and Firefox for their developer tools and Chrome above all for ease of use and speed.  I'm also using Mac OS X Version 10.7.5.

QUESTION: Based upon your reading, to what can you attribute the difference in behaviors (or, possibly, the same behaviors) with and without the novalidate attribute in the two steps above?:
</p>
<p>
The difference in behaviors can be attributed to HTML5, which can validate forms as they are being filled in through the browser itself.  It sounds like a handy feature but could mess up the ability to test JavaScript validation features.  Without the novalidate attribute I get a dialogue box telling me to fill in all fields, but the added attribute allows me to click the submit button and send my information in to be validated by JavaScript.
