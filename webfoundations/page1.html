			<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
			<p>When I'm not over-exhausting myself by working multiple jobs at once, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, and "cooking" food.  I use those quotations because I am so impatient and scatterbrained that the food I attempt to make is often edible but very strange.  I love to do it though, and hope that some day I learn to stop burning and rubberizing everything.  My family often calls me a hippy because I go to yoga classes every day and like to drink lots of green smoothies, but the truth is that it is just as common to find me eating chocolate cake while watching a Breaking Bad or Battlestar Galactica marathon.  I love the health benefits that I've received from yoga (I've lost over 30 pounds!) but I also love cake.  Tasty, tasty cake. </p>
			<h1>My Two Cats</h1>
			<p>I have two adorable cats named Tiggie and Dusty.  And they are possibly the two dumbest creatures in existence on the planet earth.  Sometimes dusty sits and stares off into space for hours, and other times she will go into the very corner of our bedroom and face the wall like she is in time out.  Tiggie is so afraid of the outdoors that if she accidentally goes outside, she stops ten feet from the door to cower and cry like a baby until we pick her up and bring her back in. Out of all the real toys we have purchased for them, their favorite is actually the plastic ring from a soda bottle.  We used to play with Tiggie using a red bandana like it was a string, and she became so attached that it is now a security blanket for her that she runs and flops on top of whenever she gets scared. </p>
