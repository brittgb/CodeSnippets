		<h1><big><strong>Information architecture</strong></big> involves content, technology, an audience, and a purpose.</h1>  
		<h1>The content may be <em>advertising, scheduling information for a social organization, book reviews, online course material</em>, or anything else you can think of.</h1>
		<h2>The technology involved includes <em>creating and marking up the content, delivering it across many platforms </em> and <em>displaying it on many different types of browsers.</em></h2>
		<h3>Graphics and other media can be incorporated.</h3> 
		<h4><em>Indexing, embedded keyword tagging</em> and other aids for searching and retrieving information can be critical.</h4>
		<h5>The audience is everyone in the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. </h5> 
		<h6>The purpose?  To <em>inform</em>, to <em>sell</em>, to <em>show off</em>, to <em>reach out</em>... in short any and every objective that daily communication among humans has ever (or will ever) have!</h6>
