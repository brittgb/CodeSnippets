				<h2 id="about">About Britt</h2>
				<p>
					I am a 200 hour Registered Yoga Instructor dedicated to creating a yoga space that is accessible to all, no matter where you've come from or where you are going.  I believe that yoga is a universal tool that facilitates both physical and mental healing and can be a catalyst to social change.  When we get to know our bodies better, magic happens!  
				</p>
				<p>
					In other words...
				</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>You don't have to be a young, thin, wealthy female sitting on a beach at sunset in order to benefit from yoga.  Are you currently a living being?  If so, than yoga is for you! </li>
						<li> Even though we often look like we are performing physical exercises, yoga cultivates a mind-body awareness, and when we become more aware of ourselves it changes the way we interact with each other.  Heal yourself, heal the world. </li>
						<li> I'm highly imperfect and so are you, but if we can start getting real with each other we can lay aside our egos and start reaching out to support and build our community. </li>
					</ul> 
				</p>
				<p>
					I am available for individual or small group lessons, community classes, consulting/partnerships with non-profits, and any other creative ideas you might come up with.  I am a big passionate social justice nerd (+ full time non-profit professional) and love talking with organizations about adding holistic health components to their programs, so please stick around a while to see my resources or ask me questions about building holistic health components into your programs!
