				<h2>Why Private Instruction?</h2>
				<p>
					There are so many reasons to try a private or small group lesson!  Maybe you are....
					<ul id="list">
						 <li> new to yoga and overwhelmed by fast paced classes </li>
						 <li> have burning questions you've always wanted to know but never knew who to ask </li>
						 <li> working through an injury </li>
						 <li> looking for modifications to help make yoga more accessible with your unique body or situation </li>
						 <li> hoping to dive deep into a particular area of your practice </li>
						 <li> are pregnant or a new mom and looking for a therapeutic practice </li>
						 <li> curious about pranayama, meditation, or aspects of yoga philosophy that aren't covered as often in studio classes.</li>
						 <li> starting a home practice but don't know what you should be focusing on.</li>
						 <li> looking for a fun bonding activity for you and a small group of friends or family.</li>
					 </ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					No matter the situation, private sessions can be a great way to deepen your practice!    
				</p>
				<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
				<p>
					Depending on where you live and what your needs are, we can meet in my home, in a public rented space, or wherever you are.  Travel fees might apply outside of a certain range.  During the first session, we will meet for an extra 15 minutes to talk about what you'd like to get out of your time with me.  Within 24 hours of your session I will email you a document with notes and pictures of the poses in your customized home routine.  If you have any questions about your practice after our meeting, I'm happy to email back and forth with you.  The best benefits of yoga happen over time, so I want to be available as a support over an extended period if that is something that will be of benefit to you.  Visit the pricing page to find out more information about session fees.

				<h2>Sign me up!</h2>
