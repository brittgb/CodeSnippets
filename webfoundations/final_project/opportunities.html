					On a frigid December evening in 2009 I tried my first yoga class on a whim after spotting a  studio out the window of one of my college classes (I was daydreaming, of course).  I was shocked to find that it was the first time in 6 years that I didn't feel exhausted and weak after a workout.  Since my early teens I'd struggled with several health concerns that frequently led me to the brink of failing school, made it difficult to maintain employment, and led to a lot of lost friendships and opportunities as I spent most of my time locked in my room.  Yoga wasn't a magical cure all, but it did help me re-establish a healthy relationship with my body and develop a lifestyle to manage my health in a much more proactive way.  It has been a slow, often frustrating, but beautiful journey.  I've been hooked on yoga and holistic health since day one, and I love sharing the lessons I've learned with others.

					During my “day job” I work in the non-profit sector with a particular interest in program development for homeless shelters and housing programs.  I feel that yoga compliments this well; in both cases the goal is to create an awakened community of people who truly care for one another and who have the space to grow and heal on all levels: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.
